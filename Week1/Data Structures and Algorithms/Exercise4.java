/**
 * Exercise 4: Employee Management System
 *
 * Scenario:
 * Efficiently managing employee records is crucial in an employee management system.
 *
 * 1. Understand Array Representation:
 * Arrays in Memory:
 * - Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations.
 * - Each element is accessed using an index, making access time O(1).
 * - Arrays have a fixed size, which must be declared at the time of creation.
 *
 * Advantages of Arrays:
 * - Fast access time (O(1)) for reading or writing elements.
 * - Simple and easy to use for fixed-size collections of elements.
 * - Memory locality improves cache performance.
 *
 * 2. Setup:
 * - Create a class Employee with attributes like employeeId, name, position, and salary.
 *
 * 3. Implementation:
 * - Use an array to store employee records.
 * - Implement methods to add, search, traverse, and delete employees in the array.
 *
 * 4. Analysis:
 * - Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, search, traverse, delete).
 * - Discuss the limitations of arrays and when to use them.
 *
 * Time Complexity Analysis:
 * - Add: O(1) if there's space, O(n) if resizing is needed.
 * - Search: O(n) in the worst case.
 * - Traverse: O(n).
 * - Delete: O(n) in the worst case due to shifting elements.
 *
 * Limitations of Arrays:
 * - Fixed size: Once created, the size cannot be changed. Resizing requires creating a new array and copying elements.
 * - Inefficient for dynamic collections where size frequently changes.
 * - Deletion and insertion operations can be costly due to shifting elements.
