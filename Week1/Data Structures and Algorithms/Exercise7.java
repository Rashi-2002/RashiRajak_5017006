/**
 * Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting
 *
 * Scenario:
 * Developing a financial forecasting tool that predicts future values based on past data.
 *
 * 1. Understand Recursive Algorithms:
 *
 * Recursion:
 * - A method calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.
 * - Useful for problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems.
 * - Base case: Stops the recursion to avoid infinite loops.
 * - Recursive case: The part of the method that includes the recursive call.
 *
 * 2. Setup:
 * - Create a method to calculate the future value using a recursive approach.
 *
 * 3. Implementation:
 * - Implement a recursive algorithm to predict future values based on past growth rates.
 *
 * 4. Analysis:
 * - Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
 * - Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
 *
 * Time Complexity Analysis:
 * - The time complexity of the basic recursive approach is O(n), where n is the number of years to predict.
 * - Optimization using memoization can reduce redundant calculations, improving efficiency.
