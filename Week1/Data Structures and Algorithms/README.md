## Repository Structure

The repository contains Java files for each exercise assigned in Week 1(Data Structures and Algorithms). Each exercise is implemented with proper comments explaining the theory and practical aspects.

### Exercise List

1. **Inventory Management System**: Efficient data storage and retrieval in a warehouse setting.
2. **E-commerce Platform Search Function**: Optimizing search functionality for fast performance.
3. **Sorting Customer Orders**: Sorting customer orders by their total price.
4. **Employee Management System**: Managing employee records efficiently.
5. **Task Management System**: Efficiently managing tasks using linked lists.
6. **Library Management System**: Searching for books by title or author.
7. **Financial Forecasting**: Predicting future values based on past data using recursive algorithms.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
