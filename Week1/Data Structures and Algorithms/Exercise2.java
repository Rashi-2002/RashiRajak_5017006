/**
 * Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function
 *
 * Scenario:
 * Developing the search functionality of an e-commerce platform. The search needs to be optimized for fast performance.
 *
 * 1. Understand Asymptotic Notation:
 *
 * Big O Notation:
 * - Describes the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm, showing how the runtime grows with input size.
 * - Helps in analyzing the efficiency of algorithms, especially for large inputs.
 *
 * Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios:
 * - Best Case: The minimum time required for the algorithm to complete (e.g., finding an element in the first position).
 * - Average Case: The expected time required for the algorithm to complete, averaged over all possible inputs.
 * - Worst Case: The maximum time required for the algorithm to complete (e.g., searching through the entire array).
 *
 * 2. Setup:
 * - Create a class Product with attributes for searching, such as productId, productName, and category.
 *
 * 3. Implementation:
 * - Implement linear search and binary search algorithms.
 * - Store products in an array for linear search and a sorted array for binary search.
 *
 * 4. Analysis:
 * - Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
 * - Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

/**
 * Analysis:
 *
 * Time Complexity of Linear Search:
 * - Best Case: O(1) (if the target is at the first position)
 * - Average Case: O(n)
 * - Worst Case: O(n) (if the target is at the last position or not present)
 *
 * Time Complexity of Binary Search:
 * - Best Case: O(1) (if the target is at the middle position initially)
 * - Average Case: O(log n)
 * - Worst Case: O(log n) (after splitting the array multiple times)
 *
 * Suitability for Platform:
 * - Linear Search: Suitable for small datasets where the overhead of sorting is not justified.
 * - Binary Search: Suitable for large datasets that are or can be sorted, as it provides much faster search times.
