/**
 * Exercise 6: Library Management System
 *
 * Scenario:
 * Users can search for books by title or author in a library management system.
 *
 * 1. Understand Search Algorithms:
 *
 * Linear Search:
 * - Checks each element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.
 * - Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst case.
 *
 * Binary Search:
 * - Works on sorted arrays.
 * - Divides the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
 * - Time Complexity: O(log n) in the worst case.
 *
 * 2. Setup:
 * - Create a class Book with attributes like bookId, title, and author.
 *
 * 3. Implementation:
 * - Implement linear search to find books by title.
 * - Implement binary search to find books by title (assuming the list is sorted).
 *
 * 4. Analysis:
 * - Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
 * - Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.

/**
 * Analysis:
 *
 * Time Complexity Comparison:
 * - Linear Search: O(n) in the worst case, as it may need to check each element in the array.
 * - Binary Search: O(log n) in the worst case, as it divides the search interval in half each time.
 *
 * When to Use Each Algorithm:
 * - Use Linear Search when the list is unsorted or when the dataset is small, as sorting an unsorted list before performing binary search may not be efficient.
 * - Use Binary Search when the list is sorted, especially for large datasets, as it is much faster than linear search due to its logarithmic time complexity.
