## Instructions

1. **Set Up Database:**
   - Run the `Schema_Creation_and_Sample_Data.sql` script to create the database schema and insert sample data.
   
   ```sql
   @Schema_Creation_and_Sample_Data.sql
2. **Execute Exercises:**

- For each exercise, execute the corresponding SQL script to test the functionality. Each script is designed to demonstrate specific PL/SQL, stored procedures, functions, triggers, or cursor operations.
